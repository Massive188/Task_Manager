1. Define the Scope
	- Core Features: 
Task List: Display a list of tasks with details like title, description, priority, due date, and status (not started, in progress, completed).
Add Tasks: Allow users to add new tasks with details like title, description, due date, and priority.
Delete Tasks: allow users to delete tasks. 
Edit Tasks: Allow users to edit the details of an existing task (Change the title, description, or due date).
Mark Task as Complete: Provide an option to mark tasks as completed.
Sort and Filter tasks: Allow users to filter tasks by status, priority, due date, etc.
Save tasks: Persist tasks to a file or database so they are available when the app is closed and reopened.		

	- Advanced features (Optional):
Task Reminders: notify users about upcoming tasks based on the due date or user-defined reminders.
Priority Management: Let users prioritize tasks and sort tasks based on their priority (high, medium, low).
Category Tags: add categories or tags to tasks for better organization.
Graphical User interface (GUI): Create a GUI to display tasks, add new tasks, and provide interactive options. (Optional for now, could be developed using libraries like Qt or SDL).
Data Backup: Backup task data and restore it. 
2. Select Development Tools and Libraries
Compiler: Use a modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, VScode).
Libraries:
File I/O: Use C++ file handling to save and load tasks (use stream or stream for reading/writing to text files).
Date/Time: Use C++11 or later for working with date and time (std::chronologically or std::tm from <ctime>).
GUI(Optional): For a graphical interface, use QT(cross-platform GUI toolkit) or SFML.
Data Persistence: Use JSON or XML libraries for storing tasks in a structured format ( nlohmann/json library for JSON serialization).

3. System Requirements and Architecture
Platform: C++ code will work cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux).
Design Pattern: Use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:
Model: Represents the data structure for tasks (Task class).
View: user interface for displaying tasks (CLI or GUI).
Controller: Handles user input, task management operations (add, edit, delete, etc).

4. Create a Detailed Task Breakdown
	4.1 Design Data Structure
Define a Task class to represent individual tasks.







	4.2 Task Management Functions
Add Task: Create a function that accepts user input and adds a task to the list.
Example: void addTask(std::vector<Task>& tasks);	
Delete Task: Create a function to remove a task from the list.
Example: void edittasks(std::vector<Task>& tasks, int taskIndex);	
 Edit Task: Create a function to modify the properties of an existing task.
Example: void editTask(std::vector<Task>& tasks, int taskIndex);		
Mark Task as Completed: Create a function to mark a task as completed.
Example: void markTaskCompleted(std::vector<Task>& tasks, int taskIndex);	
4.3. Task Display & Sorting
Display Tasks: Create a function to display tasks in a user-friendly way, showing details like title, due date, priority, and status.
Example: void displayTasks(const std::vector<Task>& tasks);
Sort Tasks: Create a function to sort tasks based on priority, due date, or completion status.
Example: void sortTasksByPriority(std::vector<Task>& tasks);
4.4. File I/O (Saving and Loading Tasks)
Save Tasks to File: Create a function to save tasks to a file (e.g., tasks.txt or tasks.json).
Example: void saveTasksToFile(const std::vector<Task>& tasks);
Load Tasks from File: Create a function to load tasks from a saved file when the application starts.
Example: void loadTasksFromFile(std::vector<Task>& tasks);

4.5. User Interface (CLI or GUI)
CLI Interface: A simple menu to interact with the user and manage tasks.
Example menu:plaintextCopy code1. Add Task
2. Edit Task
3. Delete Task
4. Mark Task as Complete
5. Display Tasks
6. Sort Tasks
7. Exit

GUI Interface (Optional): If you choose to use a GUI, design windows or dialog boxes to display and manage tasks, with buttons for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

5. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up Development Environment
Install necessary tools like a C++ compiler (GCC/Clang) and an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion).
Set up a project folder with source code files and any dependencies (e.g., a JSON library if needed).
Step 2: Define Core Classes
Implement the Task class.
Implement a container (e.g., std::vector<Task>) to hold multiple tasks.
Implement basic task management functions (add, delete, edit, complete).
Step 3: Implement Task Display and Sorting
Create functions to display tasks in a readable format.
Implement sorting functionality (by priority, due date, or completion status).
Step 4: File I/O
Implement functions to save and load tasks from files (e.g., tasks.txt or tasks.json).
Test saving and loading tasks after program restarts.
Step 5: User Interface (CLI or GUI)
For CLI, implement a simple menu-driven interface where users can choose actions (e.g., adding a task, editing, displaying, etc.).
For GUI (optional), use a framework like Qt or SFML to create interactive windows for task management.
Step 6: Testing and Debugging
Test the app with sample tasks to ensure all features (adding, editing, displaying, sorting, saving, and loading) work correctly.
Handle edge cases (e.g., empty task list, invalid user input).

6. Refinement and Additional Features
Step 1: Handle Errors Gracefully
Ensure the application handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent task indices).
Handle file errors (e.g., file not found, read/write errors).
Step 2: Optimize Performance
If the number of tasks becomes large, consider optimizing task searching and sorting algorithms.
Step 3: Optional Advanced Features
Add task reminders using system notifications or a built-in timer.
Implement task categories or tags to organize tasks further.

7. Future Enhancements
Cross-Platform Support: Ensure compatibility with both Windows and Linux/macOS platforms if needed.
Advanced Task Management: Add features like task dependencies, repeating tasks, or task comments.
Cloud Syncing: Add an option to sync tasks across devices (e.g., using an API like Firebase or a custom cloud service).

Conclusion
This plan provides a roadmap for developing a C++-based Task Manager application for managing daily tasks. You can start with basic features like adding, editing, deleting, and displaying tasks, then gradually enhance the application with sorting, file I/O, reminders, and a GUI.
